# dice-wager-game
Basic app using Flutter.

4 Dice are rolled..🎲🎲🎲🎲
Bet on how many show the same value!💸💸

Your wager gets multiplied by the same amount predicted. If you bet on a double, your wager gets doubled.
So, you lose twice the amount or... win back that much 👀👀.

PS: Doesn't include extra fancy functionality like music and fancy animations.

Included the yaml file due to extra dependencies added (flutter toast).
